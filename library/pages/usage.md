## Recommended Usage (ES6 modules)

##### Recommended usage requires that your babel presets are set up correctly. create-react-app and environments that do not transpile code within node_modules are not compatible with the component import below. All the examples on the documentation site use this syntax. You can use the Babel preset, @react-lightning-components, to get started. This preset will keep Babel compatible with React Lightning Components and allow ES6 module benefits such as tree-shaking.
